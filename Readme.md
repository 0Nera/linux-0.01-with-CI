linux-0.01 On Ubuntu 18.04/20.04


Revised version of the first kernel that can be compiled on machines with Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 64 and 32 bit versions on Intel/AMD. 

The kernel runs in both emulators: QEMU ver. 2.11.1 and Bochs ver 2.6. and that was a great success for me ...

I also uploaded the bochsrc.txt file so that the bochs runs from the command line from the root where the kernel(Image) is
and qemu runs from the cmd line by the command: make run, but first unzip the file hd_oldlinux.img.zip.

Enjoy work and improvement.
sincerely 
Isoux
